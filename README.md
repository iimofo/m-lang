# M- Programming Language Interpreter

M- is a lightweight, interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use. This project provides an interpreter that allows you to write and run M- code easily.

## Features

- Simple syntax for defining views, components, and functions.
- Supports basic data types like strings, numbers, and assignments.
- Allows for component rendering and function definitions.

## Getting Started

### Usage

To use the M- interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Create an M- Code File**:
   - Open your favorite text editor or IDE (like Visual Studio Code).
   - Create a new file and save it with a `.m` extension. For example, you can name it `example.m`.

2. **Write Your M- Code**:
   - Hereâ€™s an example of what your M- code might look like:

   ```m
   component MyCustomView {
       Text("This is my custom view")
   }

   MyCustomView()



### Customization
- **File Name**: Adjust `example.m` to any name you prefer, or you can include multiple examples.
- **Output**: Modify the expected output based on what your interpreter actually produces.

### Final Tips
- Make sure to test the example code yourself to ensure everything works as described.
- Consider adding additional examples to showcase more features of the M- language.
